Instruction for "MySQL Workbench":

creating/checking for a schema:
	open the "MySQL Workbench" application
	left-click "Schemas" in left bar under "Navigator", next to "Administration", and above "Information"
	if there is not an object named "datesdb", right-click the empty space under the other objects and left-click "Create Schema..."
		in the middle of the screen, there should be a box labeled "Name:"
		replace the text in the box with "datesdb" and left-click the box that says "Apply"
		there should now be a pop-up that says "Apply SQL Script to Database"
		left-click the box that says "Apply", then left-click the boz that says "Finish"
	double-click the object in the left bar under "SCHEMAS" named "datesdb"
	right-click "datesdb" and left-click "Set as Default Schema"
	you now have a schema, which can be thought of as a list of tables 

creating the necessary tables:
	create a table in which to store your information on dates if you do not already have one
	left-click "File" in the top of the window and left-click "New Query Tab" or press "Ctrl" and "t" on the keyboard at the same time
	this will create a new tab for creating scripts
	run the following script by copying and pasting it in the new tab to create a table named "Dates":
		CREATE TABLE Dates (
    		imageAddress VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, #image location
			harvestDay DATE NOT NULL, #day of tree harvest, format YYYY-MM-DD
    		measureDay DATE NOT NULL, #day of date classification, format YYYY-MM-DD
    		barCode INT(6) UNSIGNED NOT NULL, #tree identifier
    		weight DOUBLE(3,1) NOT NULL,
    		readyOrJuicy BOOLEAN,
    		moist BOOLEAN,
    		yellow BOOLEAN,
    		halfFirm BOOLEAN,
    		firm BOOLEAN, #(AKA smooth)
    		/*
			blisterPercent DOUBLE,
    		*/
    		/*
    		blisterAmount VARCHAR(4),
    		*/
    		blistered BOOLEAN,
			skippedAStage BOOLEAN,
			dry BOOLEAN,
    		/*
    		CONSTRAINT blisterPercent_CHECK CHECK (blisterPercent>=0 AND blisterPercent<=100),
    		*/
    		/*
    		CONSTRAINT blisterAmount_CHECK CHECK (blisterAmount='none' OR blisterAmount='low' OR blisterAmount='mid' OR blisterAmount='high'),
    		*/
			CONSTRAINT Dates_PK PRIMARY KEY (imageAddress)
		);
	to run this script and creat the table, click the yellow button near the top-left of the tab

	the purpose of the next table is to store information for the KNN algorithm for classifying images
	repeat the steps for the previous table, but paste the following script into the tab instead to create a table named "TrainingData":
		CREATE TABLE TrainingData ( #for KNN algorithm
			imageAddress VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, #image location
            averageHue FLOAT(11,8) NOT NULL, #between 0-180
            averageSaturation FLOAT(11,8) NOT NULL, #between 0-255
            averageValue FLOAT(11,8) NOT NULL, #between 0-255
			#	classifications are as follows:
            #		0 = dry
            #       1 = readyOrJuicy
            #       2 = moist                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
            #       3 = firm (AKA smooth)
            #		4 = yellow
            #		5 = halfFirm
            #		6 = skippedAStage
    		classification INT NOT NULL,
            CONSTRAINT classification_CHECK CHECK (classification>=0 AND classification <=7),
    		CONSTRAINT averageHue_CHECK CHECK (averageHue>=0 AND averageHue<=180),
            CONSTRAINT averageSaturation_CHECK CHECK (averageSaturation>=0 AND averageSaturation<=255),
            CONSTRAINT averageValue_CHECK CHECK (averageValue>=0 AND averageValue<=255),
			CONSTRAINT Dates_PK PRIMARY KEY (imageAddress)
		);
	to run this script and create the table, click the yellow button near the top-left of the tab

Table Interaction:	
	if needed, tables or the data in them may need to be changed
	right-click a table's name in the column on the left labeled "SCHEMAS" to interact with it:

	table viewing:


	table editing:
	left-click "Alter Table..." to open up a tab with a menu for changing table information
	in the bottom left of the tab, click "Columns" to view and edit column information in the table
	click "Indexes" next to "Columns" to view and edit information on table entries
	when done with changes, click "Apply" to confirm changes or click "Revert" to cancel changes

	table deletion:
	left-click "Drop Table" to delete a table and all the information stored in that table
	to confirm deletion, click "Drop Now"
