# --- preprocessing - before binarized 
# Gaussian Blurring 

# --- preprocessing - binarization methods 

# Canny Edge Detection # - useful for edges, not super reliable in this context where color is the defining factor. It keeps getting the texture crap of the date 
# Subtraction 
# Thresholding/Segmentation

# --- preprocessing - already binarized 
# MORPH_CLOSE closes gaps between pixels 
# morphologyEx processing on binary images (dialation and erosion) 

# create a boundary around all pixels - separate library 

# contouring 

# --- process
# use binary image as a mask on the original image
